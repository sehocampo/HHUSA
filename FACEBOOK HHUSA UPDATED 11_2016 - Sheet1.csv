""I remember joining the team in 2010 when we helped, literally, about 2 veterans per month get jobs. The distance between that rate of success and our current rate, which sometimes approaches 200 clients confirmed hired in a single week, is largely due to three factors. First and most important, we have an exceptionally talented team that believes in our mission and in the economic potential of our nation's military and military families. Second, we have remained narrowly focused on veteran unemployment as the contributing factor to so many other challenges faced by veterans and military families. Third, we have benefitted from remarkably loyal and generous donors and supporters, without whom we would have been nothing but a flash in the pan. The truly exciting part of reaching this milestone is we can now set our sights on 100,000 confirmed hires and know it is completely achievable.""",24,0,8,PHOTO

I hope this letter finds you enjoying your holidays this year. The team at Hire Heroes USA has been working overtime to close out the year with a tremendous amount of Veterans and new companies utilizing our services. While we are proud of our weekly average of 4.5 veteran hires, we are striving for much greater output. We will continue to grow this organization strategically to meet the ever-growing demand of our services, as the military continues to downsize and more of our nations heroes look for their next career. 



I hope everyone was able to see the clips of our Chairman, John Bardis, on Fox and Friends this month speaking about Hire Heroes USA. If not, please feel free to view the video now: http://video.foxnews.com/v/1332666291001/hire-heroes-usa/. Hire Heroes USA is quickly becoming the largest veteran employment not for profit in the country. 



We are so grateful to all of you for helping us get to this point. I must personally thank CresaPartners in Atlanta for their recent donation of $50,000. This again displays the dedication of our corporate partners and donors to ensure our service men and women are given every opportunity to succeed.



From all of us at Hire Heroes USA, please have a wonderful holiday.



Semper Fidelis,



Brian Stann

I just wanted to express my sincere gratitude to you for all the assistance you both provided to me while I was transition from the Air Force into becoming gainfully employed as a civilian. I recently accepted an offer for what I would describe as a ‚Äúdream career‚Äù as a contract specialist with the Department of Veterans Affairs. After I accepted, I spoke with the hiring authorities and they said that it was my resume, prepared by you, that scored very high and landed me the opportunity to interview. I believe that if I hadn‚Äôt received your guidance, my resume wouldn‚Äôt have gotten this sort of attention and I‚Äôd still be answering the phone as a telephone operator. So here‚Äôs a bit of proof that you, and Hire Heroes USA, provide an outstanding and truly needed service to veterans. Thank you!

Additionally, PwC has generously pledged to help Hire Heroes USA reach our shared goal of drastically decreasing the unemployment rate of the men and women who served this country.







About PwC's commitment to this cause:







PwC is actively helping governments and international alliances around the world understand and respond to increasing complex and unpredictable defence challenges. Governments and alliances, at all levels (international, national, state and local), operate in an environment characterized by increasing economic migration, changing demographics, diminishing natural resources, rising security concerns, financial pressure, and a more demanding electorate. In today's world the mandate to transform from traditional defence capabilities has never been stronger. PwC is well-equipped to facilitate this change.







The focus of their defence offerings is helping defence organizations to become more agile - flexible, accountable, and able to rapidly respond. PwC's network of premier business advisors has strong relationships with defense leaders at the local level while also bringing knowledge of the global security environment and the complexities and dependencies therein. Below are some of the services that are delivered in a collaborative, open and direct style by PwC professionals wherever in the world you need them.
